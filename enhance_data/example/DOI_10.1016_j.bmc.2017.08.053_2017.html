   The remarkable discovery that cisplatin serves as
   <hsp sp="0.25"/>
   a chemotherapeutic agent quickly led to significant breakthroughs in metal-based anticancer complexes.

   Currently, cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin are used in clinics world-wide for the treatment of cancers, although their accompanying side effects confine their wider clinical application.

   It is necessary to identify or design novel complexes as potential alternatives to avoid these setbacks. Therefore, a number of novel platinum and non-platinum metal complexes with different structural features and anticancer activities have been synthesized and extensively evaluated

   In principle, their biological activity is closely associated with the nature of the metal ions and, the structural features of the ligands and complex structures.

   Among various metal ions, copper, as a bio-essential trace element, plays a prominent role in the active sites of many metalloproteins. In particular, Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox systems participate in different catalytic processes within the human body.

    <sup loc="post">

   Studies have indicated that many copper complexes exhibit favorable anti-proliferative activity against tumor cells, which have been attributed to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), relatively high affinity for nucleobases, and endogenous oxidative DNA damage.
   <cross-refs id="r0020" refid="b0055 b0060 b0065">

    </sup>
   </cross-refs>
   Furthermore, Cu(II) complexes are able to interact with DNA, although their ability to bind to and cleave DNA largely depends on the coordinated ligand. Azoles such as imidazole, triazole, and tetrazole, as multidentate nitrogen-donor ligands, can bridge contiguous metal centers to form diverse architectures.

   Among them, benzimidazole and its derivatives are highly desirable ligands for their unique characteristics, ability to coordinate with metal centers, good planarity, highly hydrophobic DNA interactions, and mimicry of imidazole functions in proteins.

   Accordingly, combining metal centers with benzimidazole groups may lead to synergistic antiproliferative effects, effectively limiting the adverse effects of metal ion overload and enhancing the selectivity of binding sites among complexes and bio-macromolecules.

T7 RNA polymerase and linearized plasmid DNA with a T7 promoter sequence were used in the transcription assay.

     , after HE staining and Giemsa staining, cell chromatin was observed to be condensed, and alterations in cells size were easily distinguished relative to those of untreated cells. After AO/EB staining, untreated SH-SY5Y cells displayed a green fluorescence, while the treated cells emitted orange and red fluorescence and decreased in size. These results indicate that SH-SY5Y cells exhibit typical morphological features of apoptosis due to the treatment with complex

   The research of non-platinum metal complexes is of great significance for improving our understanding of therapeutic agents. In an effort to focus on the anticancer potential of new metal complexes, four Cu(II) complexes with benzimidazole-based spacers were synthesized and completely characterized. Additionally, the cytotoxic properties of these complexes and ligands were examined in four cancer cell lines (SH-SY5Y, EC109, QBC939 and MCF7). It was found that, although the two free parent ligands showed no obvious cytotoxicity in these cells, the p-2-bmp ligand proved to be considerably more potent than the p-2-bmb ligand was in improving the cytotoxic potency of the Cu(II) complexes, indicating that ligand coordination plays an important role in the bioactive complexes. As the best candidate, complex
   <bold>
    1
   </bold>
   was further studied in other biological assays. Complex
   <bold>
    1
   </bold>
   showed superior interaction with DNA, which was due to be intercalation, and potent ability to arrest RNA transcription. In addition, flow cytometry analysis showed that complex
   <bold>
    1
   </bold>
   induced early and late apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells. Overall, these results indicate that the dinuclear complex
   <bold>

   could serve as
   <hsp sp="0.25"/>
   a very promising anticancer agent and is deserving of further investigation.

To identify apoptosis, AO/EB dual staining, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, and Giemsa staining were used to visualize and quantify the number of viable and apoptotic cells. For HE and Giemsa staining, when cells were undergoing apoptosis, the cell nuclei were stained mazarine or purple-blue.
